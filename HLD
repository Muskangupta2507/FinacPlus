Solution:-

High-Level Design Components
1. External Price Sources
            Stock Market APIs
            Mutual Fund APIs
            Multiple APIs providing prices in real-time.

2. Data Fetcher Services
      Price Fetcher Service
            Pulls data every 10 minutes from external APIs.
            Handles API rate limits and failures (with retries/fallbacks).
      Pushes price updates to a message broker.

3. Message Broker
      Example: AWS SNS/SQS, Google Pub/Sub
      Emits events like:
            PriceUpdate
            AssetUpdate
            PortfolioRecalculate

            Calculates updated asset valuations.
            Recalculates user portfolios in real-time.
      Highly scalable.

5. Database Layer (Storage)
      User Database
            Stores user details and accounts
      Portfolio Database
            Stores latest portfolio valuations.
      Asset Database
            Static asset metadata (symbols, types, etc.).
      Prefer distributed databases like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, DynamoDB depending on scale.

      Portfolio API Service
            Exposes REST/WebSocket APIs.
            Allows users to fetch their latest portfolio.

      Web or Mobile App
            Dashboard to show the portfolio.
            Polls API or listens over WebSockets for instant updates.

8. Monitoring & Reliability
Monitoring Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Datadog.
Health Checks & Alerts: For failures in data ingestion, processing, or delivery.
